trade
=====

Object oriented trade game base, general and abstract, to make diferent trading scenarios, from space to medieval

A rethink of classic trading games like Elite, OOlite, Space Trader and others.
I want to practice the C++ patterns, stl, C++11, etc. and make a clear base, maybe without graphics before, and then make
a portable, clear and extensible base for many different games.
No space ships, no laser rays, no planets. Only generic concepts like Traders, Products, Effects, Conditions, etc.

Cheers.
Antonio
